Artifact Shards can be found in [suspicious blocks](^aged_lite:archeology/suspicious) / breaking pots / using [sieves](^aged_lite:produce/sieve).


With them you can create an archeology table which is used for analysing artifacts.

Artifact Shards are quite ancient and can be combined to an unidentified artifact.

Now simply process them in an archeology table to reveal powerful ancient enchantments.
