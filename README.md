# Aged-Lite
*A light version of the original aged modpack.*

You awaken in the **Tales of Aged** wilderness.  
You quickly realize that you need to **gather supplies** & craft some **flint tools**.  
**Fresh water** and **body temperature** become important pretty soon.  
Your **character** is still **weak**, so you go an adventure to **gather experience** to increase your **skills** and attributes.  
*That's where your story begins.*
