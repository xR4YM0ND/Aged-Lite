Campfires are unlit when you place them in the world.


You need to ignite them with barks or flint and steel.

<item;earlystage:oak_bark>

You get barks from stripping logs with an axe.

There is also a changed recipe for campfires which now accept any bark besides coals.

<recipe;minecraft:campfire>

Now place [water bottles](^aged_lite:hydration/campfire) on the lit campfire.
