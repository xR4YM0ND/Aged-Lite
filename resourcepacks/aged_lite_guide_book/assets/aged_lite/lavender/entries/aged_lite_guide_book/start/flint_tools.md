Wood tools are restricted to certain levels.


Therefore you need flint tools to gather wood for example.


[Collect them from the ground](^aged_lite:start/gather) or through gravel or [sieves](^aged_lite:produce/sieve).


To make these use the [crafting rock](^aged_lite:start/crafting_rock) mentioned earlier.

You'll quickly see that [tools & weapons](^aged_lite:tools_and_weapons) are given a [rarity](^aged_lite:tools_and_weapons/tiers) with pros & cons.
